# dice-roller-kata

Kata that challenges TDD practitioners with some non-deterministic behaviour like rolling dice. How do you abstract it away?

## Kata

Implement a Dice Roller that supports [Common Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation)

Some examples of dice rolls:
- 1d4 - roll one 4-sided die
- 2d6 - roll two 6-sided dice
- 1d8+2 - roll one 8-sided die and add 2 to the result
- 1d8-2 - what's the minimum value that you should return? 
- 2d6+1d4 - roll two 6-sided dice, one 4-sided die, add the results.

## Implementations 
Other branches in this repository can contain example implementations of this kata.
